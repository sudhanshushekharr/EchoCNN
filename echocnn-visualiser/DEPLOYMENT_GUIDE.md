# EchoCNN Visualizer - Deployment Guide

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Static Files
- [ ] `public/training_analysis.json` exists and is valid JSON
- [ ] `public/tensorboard_data/` directory contains all TensorBoard files
- [ ] `public/tensorboard_data/all_tensorboard_data.json` exists

### ✅ Configuration Files
- [ ] `next.config.js` is properly configured
- [ ] `vercel.json` has correct settings
- [ ] `package.json` has correct build scripts

### ✅ Code Fixes Applied
- [ ] Color scale logic fixed in `src/lib/colors.ts`
- [ ] Error handling improved in training analysis
- [ ] TensorBoard data loading with fallbacks
- [ ] Static file headers configured

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix deployment issues: color scale, error handling, static files"
   git push
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Set build command: `npm run build`
   - Set output directory: `.next`
   - Deploy

3. **Verify Deployment:**
   - Check that spectrograms show proper colors (not black)
   - Verify training analysis loads
   - Confirm TensorBoard data is accessible

## Troubleshooting

### Black Colors in Spectrograms
- Fixed: Color normalization logic in `src/lib/colors.ts`
- Colors now properly map from blue (negative) to white (zero) to red (positive)

### Missing Training Analysis
- Fixed: Better error handling in data loading
- Static file headers configured for proper caching

### Missing TensorBoard Data
- Fixed: Improved error handling and fallback states
- Static files properly configured in `next.config.js`

## Environment Variables (if needed)
- No environment variables required for current setup
- All data is served as static files

## Build Output
- Static files are automatically included in the build
- No additional configuration needed for file serving
