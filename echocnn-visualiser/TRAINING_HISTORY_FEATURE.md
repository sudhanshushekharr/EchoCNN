## Technical Implementation

### Data Extraction
The feature uses a Python script (`parse_tensorboard.py`) to extract training metrics from TensorBoard event files:

```python
# Extracts from TensorBoard logs:
- Training loss per step
- Validation loss per step  
- Validation accuracy per step
- Learning rate per step
- Wall time for each step
```

### Analysis Features
- **Automatic Overfitting Detection**: Compares recent training vs validation trends
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifies best performing checkpoint
- **Learning Rate Analysis**: Tracks decay scheduling effectiveness
- **Statistical Insights**: Provides detailed breakdown of training metrics

### UI Components
- **TrainingHistory.tsx**: Main component with interactive charts
- **Summary Cards**: Key metrics at a glance
- **Interactive Charts**: SVG-based visualizations with hover effects
- **Export Functionality**: CSV download of training data

## Usage

### 1. Parse Training Logs
```bash
# Run the parser script
python parse_tensorboard.py

# This creates training_analysis.json with extracted metrics
```

### 2. View in Application
- Upload an audio file to trigger the analysis
- Click "Show Training History" button
- Explore different metrics using the tabbed interface
- Export data for further analysis

### 3. Interpret Results
- **Green indicators**: Good performance trends
- **Orange warnings**: Potential overfitting detected
- **Best accuracy marker**: Optimal checkpoint identification
- **Learning rate decay**: Scheduling effectiveness

## Key Insights

### Your Model Performance
Based on your training logs:
- **Best Validation Accuracy**: 85.50%
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: 84.75%
